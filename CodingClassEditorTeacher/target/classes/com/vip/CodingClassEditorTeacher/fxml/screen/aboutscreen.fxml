There is single invigilator to keep an eye on the students. the invigilator has to go to individual students to check their code to clarify their doubts. To check 30-40 students individually is a very tedious job for the invigilator. To solve all the problems we proposed Coding Class Editor on LAN (Local Area Network) project.  In this project we have two desktop applications. One for the invigilator and one For the Students. Both the applications are connected over the LAN (Local Area Network). This applications also has a messenger inbuilt in them. The invigilator gives the assignment or the coding problems through his application to the students. The students solve the problem and submit it to the invigilator through their application. This helps the invigilator to review code and clarify the doubts of the students with the help of messenger without going to them individually.
